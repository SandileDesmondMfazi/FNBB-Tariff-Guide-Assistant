# FNB Tariff Guide Chatbot

## Description

Welcome to the FNB Tariff Guide Chatbot project! This project aims to provide an interactive chatbot for answering questions related to the FNB Botswana Tariff Guide. Inspired by my 7-month attachment experience at FNB Botswana, where I worked closely with a Pricing Specialist, this chatbot is designed to handle repetitive pricing questions efficiently, freeing up valuable time for more complex queries.

As a final year student pursuing a BSc Hons in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics at Botswana Accountancy College, I developed this project to demonstrate my skills in natural language processing, data handling, and chatbot development. Currently awaiting my 2nd semester results, I am excited to transition into the professional world and contribute innovative solutions like this one.

## Features

- **Interactive Q&A**: Users can ask questions related to the FNB Botswana Tariff Guide and receive accurate, real-time responses.
- **Simple and Complex Queries**: The chatbot handles simple queries autonomously and forwards complex questions to the Pricing Specialist for further assistance.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Provides a user-friendly web interface for easy interaction with the chatbot.
- **LangChain Integration**: Utilizes free LLMs and embeddings from LangChain to ensure efficient and accurate information retrieval.
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Extracts and processes text from the FNB Botswana Tariff Guide PDF for effective querying.

## Motivation

During my attachment at FNB Botswana, I observed that the Pricing Specialist frequently received repetitive questions from the tariff guide. This project aims to automate the answering of such questions, enhancing efficiency and allowing the specialist to focus on more complex tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for development.
- **LangChain**: For embedding and question-answering models.
- **Streamlit**: For creating an interactive web application.
- **PyPDF2**: For extracting text from PDF documents.
